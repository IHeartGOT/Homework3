Design an application that will process student information for a college 
database system. Your design will have all the OOP features implemented. 
It should be able to take user input. Also show the uses of nested class, 
enum and singleton design pattern in your application. Assume you don't have 
database yet but you can store data into array or some file operation using 
BufferReader/FileReader if you want. Use all the key words in java as well as 
Conditional statement, logical statement and loops.
